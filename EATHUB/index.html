                        Muesli is a ready-to-eat cereal and a popular breakfast option consisting of rolled oats, fresh and dried fruits, seeds & nuts. The first meal of the day is the most important one, it literally breaks your night-long fast and sets the tone for the rest of the day. So, however, your days may be paced, breakfast just can't be missed.

The beauty of having muesli to kick start your day is that you receive the goodness of carbs in the form of oats and protein in the form of nuts from a single bowl. Given our hectic pace of life, we do not find the time to make something healthy in the kitchen. Muesli is a quick & easy-to-make snack with the right blend of nutrition and taste packed with healthy ingredients.
